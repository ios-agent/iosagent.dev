## Skills Overview

### CarPlay
Build CarPlay-enabled iOS apps with navigation, audio, communication, and utility experiences. Covers CPTemplateApplicationScene, all template types, navigation sessions, and more.

### SwiftUI
Complete SwiftUI framework documentation covering views, modifiers, layout, state management, animations, navigation, and data flow for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS.

### MapKit
Integrate Apple Maps with annotations, directions, local search, overlays, and LookAround. Supports both SwiftUI Map (iOS 17+) and MKMapView.

### SiriKit
Implement Siri voice interactions, Shortcuts, custom intents, and App Intents. Covers all system intent domains and custom intent definition.

### WidgetKit
Create widgets, Live Activities, watch complications, and controls. Covers all widget families, timeline providers, interactivity, and rendering modes.

### Apple Foundation Models
Build with Apple's on-device AI using SystemLanguageModel, guided generation, tool calling, and prompting patterns for iOS 26+.

### ProximityReader
Accept contactless payments on iPhone with Tap to Pay, read loyalty cards (VAS) from Apple Wallet, implement Store and Forward for offline scenarios, and verify mobile driver's licenses and IDs using the Verifier API.

### Apple Wallet
Create, sign, distribute, and update Apple Wallet passes including boarding passes, event tickets, coupons, store/loyalty cards, and generic passes. Covers pass.json structure, .pkpass bundles, NFC integration, barcode formats, push-based updates, and identity verification.

### Metal
